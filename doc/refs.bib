@article{soltisd2009diversification,
	Abstract = {Polyploidy has long been recognized as a major force
                   in angiosperm evolution. Recent genomic
                   investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is
                   ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also suggest
                   several ancient genome-doubling events. These include
                   ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events in
                   basal angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed
                   paleohexaploid event that may have occurred close to
                   the eudicot divergence. However, there is currently
                   no evidence for WGD in Amborella, the putative sister
                   spe- cies to other extant angiosperms. The question
                   is no longer ``What proportion of angiosperms are
                   polyploid?'', but ``How many epi- sodes of polyploidy
                   characterize any given lineage?'' New algorithms
                   provide promise that ancestral genomes can be
                   reconstructed for deep divergences (e.g., it may be
                   possible to reconstruct the ancestral eudicot or even
                   the ancestral angiosperm genome). Com- parisons of
                   diversification rates suggest that genome doubling
                   may have led to a dramatic increase in species
                   richness in several angiosperm lineages, including
                   Poaceae, Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae.
                   However, additional genomic studies are needed to
                   pinpoint the exact phylogenetic placement of the
                   ancient polyploidy events within these lineages and
                   to determine when novel genes resulting from
                   polyploidy have enabled adaptive radiations.},
